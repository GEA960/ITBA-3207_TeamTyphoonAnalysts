**Introduction**

---

<p align='justify'>        The Philippines' apparent vulnerability to natural disasters emerges from its geographic location within the Pacific Ring of Fire. The country is surrounded by large bodies of water and faces the Pacific Ocean, which produces 60% of the world's typhoons. Approximately twenty tropical cyclones pass through the Philippine area of responsibility each year, ten of which are typhoons and five of which are catastrophic (Brown, 2013). Due to a lack of preparedness and response, families in rural areas are more likely to be hit. According to the Weather Underground (n.d.), hurricanes are becoming a global threat as they solidify and more super tropical storms emerge. As a result, every municipality should have a high level of safety and security. However, government agencies and non-governmental organizations in the Philippines promote emergency preparedness, but they have yet to acquire the public's general attention; like in Yolanda's storm surge disaster, where there is insufficient public awareness of storm surges, higher casualties have occurred (Commission on Audit, n.d.). The Commission on Audit (n.d.) also reported that the mayor of Tacloban City stated that more lives may have been saved if storm surges were labeled as tsunami-like. According to the National Research Council et al. (1991), preparedness is indeed the way of transforming a community's awareness of potential natural hazards into actions that strengthen its ability to respond to and recover from disasters. Proposals for preparedness must address the immediate response and all the longer-term recovery and rehabilitation. </p>

<p align='justify'>        This analysis aims to construct an Exploratory Data Analysis of Typhoons from 2019 that prompted the most casualty rates in the country and data on the municipal governments that had the least number of affected families' individuals per typhoon. Moreover, global datasets about hurricanes in the U.S. from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) will be utilized in the same manner as mentioned in the Philippines Data set to know which location in the United States had the most successful response and mitigation plan for typhoons. This information will be used to construct a Typhoon Mitigation and Response Plan that may help the Philippines deal with hurricanes. Integrating various programs from other countries will increase the likelihood of Filipinos' survival and recovery from typhoons.

**Problem Statement**

---

<p align='justify'>        The primary issue addressed by this project is the lack of a mitigation and response framework among the cities and municipalities located throughout the Philippine archipelago. This was a significant component that might have a long-term impact on the lives of all Filipinos. Concerning this subject, the Senate Economic Planning Office (2017) conducted a study that evaluates the most often experienced problems and issues by various organizations in the Philippines. Among these concerns include a lack of coordination and collaboration amongst parties, the inadequate ability of line agencies and local government units to carry out DRRM tasks; reduced emphasis assigned to DRRM operations; inadequate enforcement of rules and policies; and scarcity of and difficulty in obtaining DRRM data/information. These are the concerns that this study seeks to address.

</p>

---

**Significance of the Proposed Project**

---

<p align='justify'>         This data analysis research will provide fresh light on the country's reaction to and mitigation of the consequences of typhoons. This research will specifically benefit the following: </p>

* *Government* <p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research will aid them in taking immediate action, prior to a disaster, to mitigate losses in the case of a typhoon disaster. The planning process and suggested ideas from established frameworks in the United States will assist them in determining how to plan, create, and develop the community while fostering risk-reduction collaborations.</p>
* *Community*<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research educates the community about the solutions and methods that might be implemented to ensure their safety during typhoon catastrophes and floods.</p>
* *Students*  <p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students would immediately benefit from this research since its findings may motivate them to investigate data analytics as a way to assist the community in which they live in developing efficient disaster mitigation and response plans, particularly for typhoons. They will also be informed of their precautions to safeguard themselves and their loved ones against storms and floods.</p>
* *Parents*  <p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research may persuade parents to pursue programs that include instruction to assist pupils in coping with the damaging impacts of typhoons.</p>
* *Future Researchers* <p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper discusses mitigation and response frameworks to minimize the devastation caused by typhoons. Thus, the findings of this study may be utilized to inform future conversations and analysis of effective frameworks employed by governments throughout the world that the Philippine government could adopt for its own system.</p>

**Methods**

---

<p align='justify'>        The primary issue tackled by this project is the inadequacy of a mitigation and response framework across the Philippine archipelago's cities and municipalities. This was a critical component that might have long-term consequences for the lives of all Filipinos. The Senate Economic Planning Office (2017) researches this subject, evaluating the most often encountered challenges and concerns by various organizations in the Philippines. The researchers will conduct an Exploratory analysis approach on the data sets selected for this study to address this. The primary objective of the exploratory analysis is to discover (Calzon, 2022). And according to IBM Cloud Education (2020), no concept of the link between the data and the variables existed before the analysis. Once the data has been analyzed, the exploratory analysis will assist the researchers in identifying linkages and developing ideas and answers to the deficiency of typhoon disaster mitigation and response frameworks in the Philippines. </p>

---

**Expected output**

---

<p align='justify'>        This research is planned to produce an exploratory data analysis of typhoons from the year 2019 that resulted in the highest casualty rates in the country and data on the local governments that experienced the fewest impacted families for each typhoon. Additionally, world wide hurricane datasets from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) will be used in the same way as the Philippine dataset to determine which U.S location had the best successful reaction and mitigation strategy for typhoons. This data can be utilized by the Philippine government to develop a Typhoon Mitigation and Response Plan based on the one that the U.S had, which can potentially assist the Philippines in dealing with hurricanes. By incorporating diverse strategies from other nations like the United States, the chance of the Filipinos surviving and recovering from typhoons likely increase. </p>

**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project**

---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDGs which this project aims to attain are Sustainable Cities and Communities and Climate Action. These SDGs are further described as follows;

1. **Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and
   Communities** - This SDG strives to mitigate the negative
   consequences of natural catastrophes like typhoons (globalgoals.org,
   n.d.).

   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Sustainable_Development_Goal_11.png" width="200" height="200">
2. **Goal 13: Climate Action** - This goal strives to take immediate action to address climate change and its consequences (United Nations, n.d.). Specifically, enhancing resilience and adaptation ability in all nations to climate-related dangers and natural disasters.

   <img src="https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffddialogue/images/E_SDG%20goals_icons-individual-rgb-13.png" width="200" height="200">
3. **Goal 15: Life on Land** - This SDG seeks to manage forests sustainably, prevent desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.

   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Sustainable_Development_Goal_15.png" width="200" height="200">

<p align='justify'>        These SDGs are aligned with the TMRF project as it will provide a mitigation and response plan based on the tested and used framework by the American government to their states. This framework will help the Philippine government in taking immediate action, prior to a disaster, to mitigate losses in the case of a typhoon disaster.</p>
